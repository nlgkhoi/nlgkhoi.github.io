As a technical speaker and academic team leader in the Google Developer Student Club's How-to-AI Series, I prepared topics and content for a five-day series about Artificial Intelligence and career paths in the field of AI. The series also included collaboration with AI experts to provide fireside chats with students at HCMUT, aiming to enhance their understanding and skills in AI.
