In this Machine Learning Workshop organized by the Google Developer Student Club, I served as a technical speaker and academic team leader. The workshop was aimed at providing basic knowledge of fundamental concepts and simple algorithms in Machine Learning to the students of HCMUT. The event also involved a collaboration with CoderSchool to convey more in-depth knowledge about Deep Learning to the attendees.
