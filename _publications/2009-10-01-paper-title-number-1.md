This paper presents the "Sound of Silence" project, a communication support device for people with hearing impairments. It utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to translate sign language into text and speech, making communication easier for those who are hearing impaired. The project aims to overcome the limitations of current sign language systems by developing a mobile application integrated with AI technology. This solution ensures quick recognition of sign language gestures with high accuracy and provides an accessible way for the hearing impaired to communicate with others. The project is ongoing, focusing on improving the efficiency and accuracy of the machine learning model.
